We then iterate through the board in reverse order, starting from the last row. For each square, we calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach it from the squares above it. We use the values in the board to determine the minimum number of moves required to reach each square. If a square has a snake or ladder, we use the destination of that snake or ladder to calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach it. We update the value in `dp` for the current square based on the minimum number of moves required to reach it from the squares above it. Finally, we return the value in `dp` for the square (0, 0) which represents the minimum number of moves required to reach the square 4. If it is not possible to reach the square, we return -1.",
