Yes, we can calculate the value of the question mark in the expression by adding the two numbers on the left-hand side of the question mark: 1 + 4 = 5. Then, we can add 5 to the two numbers on the right-hand side of the question mark: 2 + 5 = 12. Finally, we can add 12 to the two numbers on the left-hand side of the question mark: 3 + 6 = 21.
