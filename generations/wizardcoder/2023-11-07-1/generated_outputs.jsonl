We create a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of moves required to reach square `board[i][j]`. We initialize `dp[0][0]` to 0 since we start from square 1.\r\n\r\nWe then iterate through each square in the grid and update `dp[i][j]` based on the following rules:\r\n\r\n- If `board[i][j]` is 1, then `dp[i][j]` is 0 since we start from square 1.\r\n- If `board[i][j]` is greater than 1, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `board[i][j] - 1` since we need to move `board[i][j] - 1` squares to reach square `board[i][j]`.\r\n\r\nNext, we iterate through each square in the grid again and update `dp[i][j]` based on the following rules:\r\n\r\n- For each direction `(di, dj)` in the four cardinal directions, we check if the square `(i + di, j + dj)` is within the bounds of the grid and if `board[i + di][j + dj]` is greater than `board[i][j]`. If both conditions are true, then we update `dp[i + di][j + dj]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i][j] + 1`. This means that we need to move one square in the chosen direction to reach the destination square.\r\n\r\nFinally, we return `dp[n-1][n-1]` if it is not equal to infinity, which means we have reached square 4. Otherwise, we return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to reach square 4.",
