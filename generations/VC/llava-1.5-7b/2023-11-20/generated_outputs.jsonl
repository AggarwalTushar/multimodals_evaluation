We can do this by looking at the image and identifying the current symbol (I) and the value of current (I) inside the circle.\n\nNext, we can use the formula V = IR to calculate the value of Voltage (V). We can plug in the values of resistance (R) and current (I) into the formula to get:\n\nV = I \\* R\n\nFinally, we can solve for the value of Voltage (V) by dividing both sides of the equation by the value of resistance (R):\n\nV = I / R\n\nSince we have the value of current (I) and resistance (R) in the image, we can calculate the value of Voltage (V) using the formula V = IR.",

In this case, the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination square 4 is 3, since we need to move to 2, 3, and then 4.\n\nFor the recursive case, we can assume that the current square is not 1, and we need to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination square from the current square.

If the destination square is reachable from the current square, we can use the recursive approach to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination square.\n2.
