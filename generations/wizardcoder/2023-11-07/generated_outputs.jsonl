We create a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of moves required to reach square `board[i][j]`. We initialize the diagonal elements of the array to 0 since we can reach those squares in 1 move.\r\n\r\nWe then iterate through the array from bottom to top and from left to right. For each square `board[i][j]`, we check if it is a starting square (i.e. `board[i][j] == 1`). If it is, we set `dp[i][j] = 0` since we can reach that square in 0 moves.\r\n\r\nIf `board[i][j]` is not a starting square, we calculate the next square `next_square` by subtracting 1 from `board[i][j]`. We then check if `next_square` is within the bounds of the board. If it is, we set `dp[i][j]` to the minimum of `dp[i+1][next_square]` and `dp[i+1][next_square-n] + 1` (where `n` is the number of rows in the board). This is because if `next_square` is within the same row as `board[i][j]`, we can simply move down to `next_square`. If `next_square` is in a different row, we need to move down to the bottom row and then move right to `next_square`.\r\n\r\nFinally, we check if we have reached the square 4 (i.e. `dp[0][n-1]!= float('inf')`). If we have, we return `dp[0][n-1]` which represents the minimum number of moves required to reach square 4. If we have not reached square 4, we return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to reach square 4.",
