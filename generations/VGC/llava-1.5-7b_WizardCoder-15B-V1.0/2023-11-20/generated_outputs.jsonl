The algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph with negative weight cycles. Here's how we can implement it in Python:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ndef bellman_ford(graph, start):\r\n    distances = {vertex: float('inf') for vertex in graph}\r\n    distances[start] = 0\r\n    \r\n    for i in range(len(graph)-1):\r\n        for vertex in graph:\r\n            for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():\r\n                if distances[vertex]!= float('inf') and distances[vertex] + weight < distances[neighbor]:\r\n                    distances[neighbor] = distances[vertex] + weight\r\n    \r\n    for vertex in graph:\r\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():\r\n            if distances[vertex]!= float('inf') and distances[vertex] + weight < distances[neighbor]:\r\n                return \"Graph contains negative weight cycle\"\r\n    \r\n    return distances[3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe start by initializing the distances dictionary with infinity for all vertices except the starting vertex, which we set to 0. We then iterate over the graph multiple times, updating the distances for each vertex based on the shortest distance to its neighbors. If we encounter a negative weight cycle, we return an error message. Finally, we return the distance from the starting vertex to the target vertex (vertex 3 in this case).\r\n\r\nTo find the shortest distance between vertices 0 and 3, we call the function like this:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nprint(bellman_ford(graph, 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, the shortest distance between vertices 0 and 3 is 3.",
